# About

## Column 

### Purpose of this dashboard
This dashboard investigates patterns in the abundance and distribution of different species of birds in the 2020-21 winter in the United States and southern Canada. The data came from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/), which is a citizen science project that aims to engage individuals in North America to count birds (for as long or as little as they like) to track winter trends in bird distribution and abundance. This project has been running for more than 30 years at this point!

In this dashboard, we explore:

-   high-level overview of the observing program
-   which species were most common, and where they were found
-   species-specific distribution patterns 
-   flock sizes (for species observed at least 10 times)

This dashboard is intended for use by the general public, as well as the citizen scientists of Project FeederWatch.

# Data 

## Column 
These data were discovered and downloaded via [TidyTuesday for January 10, 2023](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-10), but originally come from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/). The data dictionary is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kHmx2XhA2MJtEyTNMpwqTQEnoa9M7Il2/view). For the purposes of this dashboard, data were filtered to focus on the continental United States and southern Canada (south of 50°N), where most observations were made. Data of questionable quality (i.e., having been identified by Project FeederWatch as being "invalid") or data that were missing critical information were omitted. A total of 96,408 unique observations were retained in this analysis.

**Where are birds observed?**

In order to understand trends in bird distribution and abundance, we first need to know where our observations are coming from.
Here is a figure showing the locations of observations.
The points are transparent, so denser bird-watching areas are shaded darker green.

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Observing locations for Project FeederWatch 2020-21 winter."}

# Prep maps of America/USA for making figures

Figure 1. Observing locations for Project FeederWatch 2020-21 winter.


Since most bird-watching happens in the mid-latitudes (defined here as 35-45ºN), we must standardize the number of birds by the number of observations.
The following figure indicates that birds are more abundant at higher latitudes even though there are fewer total observations.
However, birds become more common at lower latitudes (below 35ºN) from January to March.
This may be explained by migration to southern regions during the coldest months of the year.
The fact that more birds are reported within every latitudinal band during the coldest months may indicate that more birds visit feeders to obtain food during the harshest conditions of the year.


```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. Total number of birds observed within each latitudinal band (high: >45ºN, mid: 35-45ºN, low: <35ºN)."}
# Figure 2: Bird count per latitude band

Figure 2. Total number of birds observed within each latitudinal band (high: >45ºN, mid: 35-45ºN, low: <35ºN).

Let's now explore how often different species are observed.
A total of 361 unique species were reported, but most of these species were only observed once!
However, the most common species were observed thousands of times!
This is probably explained in part because birds are incredibly diverse, so some of these species may actually be rare, while others have may have limited distributions or be harder to identify.

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Histogram of the number of observations per species."}
# Figure 3: Histogram of bird observations per species
hist_plot <- feederwatch_df %>%
  group_by(species_code) %>%

**Which birds are most common?**

You'll probably recognize the names of some of the most common birds!
These birds were identified as "common" in the data set because they had the most observations (though not necessarily the highest total count of individuals).

```{r caption="Table 1. Most commonly observed birds in the 2020-21 winter in Project FeederWatch.", render=lemon_print}
# Table 1
commonly_sighted_birds_table <- commonly_sighted_birds %>%
  select('Common name' = primary_com_name,
         'Scientific name' = sci_name,
         'Number of observations' = count)
commonly_sighted_birds_table

```

Most of the common birds were observed throughout the U.S. (or at least where people were reportedly birdwatching, see Fig. 1).
However, some birds had more limited distributions.
For example, the blue jay and the northern cardinal were found predominantly in the eastern half of the U.S., and the black-capped chickadee was only observed in the more northern latitudes.

**Which birds flock and where?**

Have you heard the saying that "birds of a feather flock together"?
The birds in the figure below had the highest average abundance per observation.
This indicates to me that these birds tend to appear most often in large flocks.

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 5. Month and location for bird species with the largest average count per observation. The size of the circle is relative to the flock size, and the color indicates the month when the observation was made."}

**Summary**

In this example analysis, we explored patterns in the distribution and abundance of birds observed through the citizen science initiative Project FeederWatch conducted in winter 2020-21.
We found that most of the observations for this program were made in the mid-Atlantic and northeast regions of the U.S.
This pattern of observation corresponded strongly with the distribution of several of the most common birds, including the American goldfinch, dark-eyed junco, downy woodpecker, and house finch.
However, flocking birds tended to have smaller ranges but a larger number of birds reported per observation.
In general, birds were most abundant in the coldest months (January-March) and at the highest latitudes (\>45ºN).
